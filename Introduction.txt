This is to see if somebody can use GitHub to write and edit an article.
One major question is if github works line by line.
This could be an advantage be it could also be a major disadvantage.
For some reason I find it much more difficult to work on the desktop than on the online version.
Now they say that you can use a branche to work parallel to the master branch.
It looks like a did a succesful merge.
However, working with github might be overkill. But you never known. You might have to exlore this.

I have to make the following observation. It looks that you cannot edit your text unless you are on the web edition of GitHub. It could be different if you had a payed version. However so far it really looks nice to see all the previous iterations and exactly were you did change something.

To look at your thought process it might be desirable to put them in the comments.
