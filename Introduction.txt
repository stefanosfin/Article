This is to see if somebody can use GitHub to write and edit an article.
One major question is if github works line by line.
This could be an advantage be it could also be a major disadvantage.
For some reason I find it much more difficult to work on the desktop than on the online version.
Now they say that you can use a branche to work parallel to the master branch.
It looks like a did a succesful merge.
